# PyPostgresCSV: Building PostgreSQL Database with CSV Data using Python
## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a database in PostgreSQL using Python and the insertion of data from CSV files into the database tables. It involves the following steps:

1. Setting up PostgreSQL server
2. Creating a new database using Python
3. Designing and creating tables in the database using SQL queries
4. Reading data from CSV files and inserting it into the tables

## Requirements
1. Python 3
2. PostgreSQL
3. The `psycopg2` library

## Directory Structure
`data/` : Directory containing CSV files with data to be inserted into the tables.

`postgresql-python.ipynb` : The main Python script to create tables and insert data into the database.

## Usage
Once the tables have been created and the data has been inserted, you can query the database using SQL.
